## Description

This is a simple weather website that allows you to search up cities and get the current weather for them as well as a five-day forecast.

## Installation

No need to install anything! Just head over to the website [here](https://weather-dashboard-7nxn.onrender.com) to get started.

## Usage

Simply head to the website, type a city name under "Search for a city", and press the search button. There's already some preloaded cities if you want to search those up as well.
